## Well, it happened. I Wrote a 600-Page Book About My LLM Mad Experiments

By some miracle of fate, and the pure, unadulterated terror of having to actually finish the damned thing, my last two years of feverish, frustrating, and occasionally glorious LLM experiments have been distilled into a real, live, actual book! And not some little pamphlet, but a whopping 600 freaking pages long!

And not just any book either, but "The Cranky Man's Guide to LoRA & QLoRA"!

So, if you ever accidentally ran one of my tools (like mass_rewriter, VirtualLora or Training PRO), then this is both the user guide AND the origin story! It's really me, letting you in on the whole seamy, backstage-pass, "get into my head" kind of thing. 

This isn't some boring academic paper with lots of footnotes and incomprehensible jargon and references to obscure papers by people whose names I've never heard of and never want to hear of. Nope! Instead it is a gigantic compendium of my own personal notes, ideas, lessons learned (mostly the hard way) and tons and tons of epic failures which I proudly present as shining examples of how not to do things. Everything is there, from pre-chewed "bathroom theory" of LLMs (absolutely no math or highfalutin intellectual mumbo jumbo) all the way to dealing with all the delightful, error messages and segfaults that are an essential part of the LLM fine-tuning experience. 

But the real jewel in the crown of this book is the "Cranky Trenches" section, where I take you by the hand and lovingly, lovingly walk you, step-by-step, through the hideous, horrible, horrifying mess that is actually training an LLM, whether it's my Sydney chatbot, Plot-Bot, or an exhaustive exploration of style transfer (perhaps TOO exhaustive, perhaps). It's all in there! The triumphs! The near-triumphs! The utter, abject, humiliating failures!

If this whole thing suddenly sounds like your kind of madness, and you want to know the whole story, here are some ways to find it:

*   [Amazon (Kindle & Paperback)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FLBTR2FS)
